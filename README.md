# Public Internet NYC
A static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website for the the NYC DSA Tech Action working group's Public Internet campaign.

## Running Locally
- Copy this repo: `git clone https://github.com/nyc-dsa-tech-action/nyc-dsa-tech-action.github.io.git`
- Install all the prerequisites listed [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
- Install the jekyll and bundler gems: `gem install jekyll bundler`
- Build the site and make it available on a local server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Navigate to the local running site: http://localhost:4000
- **Note**: these instructions are just the [Jekyll quickstart instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/#instructions) without steps 3 and 4 because those are for creating a **new** Jekyll site. Those commands generate a directory with some config files, including a Gemfile that is needed to run locally but that's already in this repo.
