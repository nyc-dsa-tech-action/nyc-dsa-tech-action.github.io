            The following are the principles we believe any NYC municipal broadband network must abide by:
          </Heading>

          <UnorderedList spacing={5}>
            <ListItem>
              High quality, high speed fiber broadband should be built and staffed by a fully unionized NYC-based public entity,
              with democratic controls to ensure it is always acting in the public interest.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Broadband should be universally available - every person and business living in NYC, regardless of status, should
              have broadband.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              This public, non-profit utility service will be available regardless of ability to pay. Rates will be 
              democratically set and low-cost.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Each household should be supplied with wireless routers for free on fixed replacement plans.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Data privacy must be paramount - the broadband entity should collect as little information as necessary, be
              transparent about what information is collected, store the information securely, and maintain confidentiality between individuals and the broadband entity.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              New Yorkers must be able to determine how their data is or is not used.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              A highly trained, robust union workforce will be responsible for customer service and maintenance, including 24/7
              local support and quick, conveniently scheduled service visits when needed.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Existing network infrastructure will be retrofitted to ensure longevity, and new infrastructure will be built with
              environmental impacts and best practices in mind.
            </ListItem>
