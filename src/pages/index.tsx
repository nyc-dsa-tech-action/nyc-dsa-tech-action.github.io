          With the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, internet access has become even more critical to New Yorkers' lives in
          finding employment, accessing government services, and connecting with loved ones. Internet access in New York
          City, however, remains expensive and slow, and barriers to access fall disproportionately along lines of race,
          age, disability, immigration status, and economic status.

        <Text m={4}>
          To achieve truly equitable Internet access for our communities and ensure that all New Yorkers have the resources
          needed to recover from our current crisis, we cannot allow New York City to continue subsidizing the same
          union-busting corporations who have failed time and again to provide functional, reliable, equitable, and
          inexpensive internet to all New Yorkers. Instead of private Internet monopolies,

                  We have the existing infrastructure: thousands of miles of free conduit in the Bronx and Manhattan,
                  thousands of City owned buildings with fiber connectivity, multiple existing municipal networks, and many
                  thousands of available utility poles are just a portion of the infrastructure available to the City.

                  We have the people power: experienced IBEW Local 3 workers ready to hit the ground running and multiple City
                  agencies and employees with expertise in network and call-center operations and more.

                  We have the money: In the short term, the City is already spending big and giving away infrastructure to
                  facilitate network expansion by private ISP’s – this makes sense where it addresses immediate connectivity
                  needs but is not the long-term solution. In the medium to long term, funding may be supported by subscriber
                  fees, state and federal funding and some borrowing. Targeted ISP taxes, low-cost infrastructure buyouts, and
                  additional state and local legislation will all help to drive down costs for the municipal network.
