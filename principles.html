      <h1>The following are the principles we believe any NYC municipal broadband network must abide by:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>High quality, high speed fiber broadband should be built and staffed by a fully unionized NYC-based public
            entity, with democratic controls to ensure it is always acting in the public interest.</li>
        <li>Broadband should be universally available - every person and business living in NYC, regardless of status,
            should have broadband.</li>
        <li>This public, non-profit utility service will be available regardless of ability to pay. Rates will be
            democratically set and low-cost.</li>
        <li>Each household should be supplied with wireless routers for free on fixed replacement plans.</li>
        <li>Data privacy must be paramount - the broadband entity should collect as little information as necessary, be
            transparent about what information is collected, store the information securely, and maintain confidentiality
            between individuals and the broadband entity.</li>
        <li>New Yorkers must be able to determine how their data is or is not used.</li>
        <li>A highly trained, robust union workforce will be responsible for customer service and maintenance, including
            24/7 local support and quick, conveniently scheduled service visits when needed.</li>
        <li>Existing network infrastructure will be retrofitted to ensure longevity, and new infrastructure will be built
            with environmental impacts and best practices in mind.</li>
      </ul>
